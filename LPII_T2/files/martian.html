   <h2>Red Hot Chili Peppers</h2>

<p>
Bear paws and rascal power<br>
Watching us in your garage<br>
Big girl you ate the neighbor<br>
The nova is over<br>
Wake up and play<br>
Balleradio<br>
Make room for clara's bare feet<br>
The love of a martian<br>
</p>

<p>
Tick tock and waiting for the meteor<br>
This clock is opening another door<br>
</p>

<p>
Lots of love just keep it comin'<br>
Making something out of nothin'<br>
These are the best that I<br>
I don't know how to say<br>
Losin' what I love today<br>
These are the best that I<br>
</p>

<p>
Lots of love just keep it comin'<br>
Making something out of nothin'<br>
These are the best that I<br>
I don't know what to say<br>
Look at what I lost today<br>
And these are the things that I<br>
</p>

<p>
Blood flowers in the kitchen<br>
Signing off and winding down<br>
This martain ends her mission<br>
The nova is over<br>
She caught the ball<br>
By the mission bell<br>
Chase lizards bark at donkeys<br>
The love of a martian<br>
</p>

<p>
Let's bow our heads<br>
And let the trumpets blow<br>
Our girl is gone<br>
God bless her little soul<br>
</p>

<p>
She's got sword in case<br>
Tho this is not her lord incase<br>
The one who can't afford to face<br>
Her image is restored to grace<br>
</p>

<p>
Disappeared<br>
No trace<br>
Musky tears<br>
Suitcase<br>
</p>

<p>
The down turn brave<br>
Little burncub bearcareless turnip snare<br>
Rampages pitch color pages...<br>
Down and out but not in Vegas<br>
Disembarks and disengages<br>
No loft<br>
</p>

<p>
Sweet pink canary cages plummet pop dewskin fortitude<br>
For the sniffing black noses that snort and allude<br>
To dangling trinkets that mimic the dirt cough go drink its<br>
It's for you<br>
</p>

<p>
Blue battered naval town slip kisses delivered by duck<br>
Muscles and bottlenosed grifters arrive in time to catch the late show<br>
It's a beehive barrel race<br>
A shehive stare and chase wasted feature<br>
Who tried and failed to reach her<br>
Embossed beneath a box in the closet that's lost<br>
The kind that you find when you mind your own mysteries<br>
Shiv sister to the quickness before it blisters<br>
Into the newmorning milk blanket<br>
Your ilk is funny to the turnstyle touch bunny<br>
Whose bouquet set a course for bloom without decay<br>
Get you broom and sweep the echoes of yesternights<br>
Fallen freckles away<br>
</p>
